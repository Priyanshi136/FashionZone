# FashionZone
An online shopping app, just frontend.
Learnt and implemented some new concepts like:

a) Bottom Navigation bar for easy traverse in the app -> labelling, icons, different colors before clicking and after clicking.
b) In the middle of the bar, a floating action button(FAB) i.e. also the default fragment.
c) Fragments-> Four different fragments for the four menu items of the navigation bar.
d) Some cool ui stuffs-> card views, backgrounds, icons....etc.
